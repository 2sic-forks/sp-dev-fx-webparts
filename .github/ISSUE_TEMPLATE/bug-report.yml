        Because of the way this repository is configured, samples authors do not get a notification when you create an issue. 
        
        For the section above **@mention any author of the sample**. Authors' GitHub handle can be found on the main sample documentation page, under the "Solution" section. 
        
        Don't @mention the repo maintainers, they already get notified.
