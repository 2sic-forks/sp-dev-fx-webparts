# Using Azure OpenAI Connectors API

## Summary

This (__experimental__) webpart, shows how to use the new feature (_in preview at the moment of building this sample_) Azure OpenAI Data Connectors.

![./assets/react-azure-openai-connector.gif](./assets/react-azure-openai-connector.gif)

The webpart is calling the Azure OpenAI API, with a specific Data source configured to an existing Azure Search service that contains the Hotels index provided by Microsoft. The following screenshots shows how you can configure the connector throught the new Azure OpenAI Studio. This is **NOT required** for the sample, but helps to understand what the webpart is doing behind the scenes.

First, you have configured your Search service (any tier except the free one) importing the Hotels data sample provided by Microsoft

Now, from the [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal), in the _Chat playground_, you can configure your data connector:

Connect it to your Azure Search Hotels index:

Follow the assistant to create the Connector. Once is done, you can use chatGPT to find hotels using natural language:

The webpart offers the same functionality, showing how to call the Azure OpenAI API, with a pre-configured Data source.

__Note__: this is an experimental sample, based on the preview of the Azure OpenAI service, and the preview of the Data Connectors. Ensure you check the _prerequisites_ section if you are planning to run this sample.

## Used SharePoint Framework Version
