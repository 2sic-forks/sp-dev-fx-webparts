<!-- 
PRO TIP:

For commands, use the `code syntax`

For button labels, page names, dialog names, etc. as they appear on the screen, use **Bold**

Don't use "click", use "select" or "use"

As tempting as it may be, don't just use images to describe the steps. Let's be as inclusive as possible and think about accessibility.
