# Company Stories Web part

## Summary

This web part allows you to add images to a SharePoint List, and renders them with a UX very similar to Instagram Stories (or Twitter Reels, or [Place your Social network here]). It is a way to engage employees, showing relevant content in a well-known visual appearance.
