# My Awards

## Summary

This webpart is using the beta MS Graph Profile endpoint to list your awards. At the time of writing this sample (May 2022), this is a Beta endpoint, so it could change in the future. A future version of this webpart could include the ability to add new awards to your profile. 

In the meantime, you can add a new award using this request: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profile-post-awards?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profile-post-awards?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http) (You can use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) tool to do so.)
