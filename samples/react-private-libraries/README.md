# Private Folder Manager

## Summary

This sample provides a webpart that can be used to manage Document Libraries with Secured Subfolders. The use case this was developed for is a Request for Proposal site. A Document library is created for each RFP and subfolders are created within that Library for each external supplier invited to participate in that RFP.

The application manages all the security groups set up for the various libraries and folders so that suppliers only see RFP's they were ivited to participate in and only thier folders.
