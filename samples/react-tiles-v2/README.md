# Tiles-V2

## Summary

This solution creates a customisable Tiles Webpart, it uses a stored collection from the PnP PropertyFieldCollectionData control and allows the user to choose the colour scheme (theme or custom) and to set the size of the tiles. By default the tiles use a fluid flex layout to use the available screen area.

This is a rebuild of the awesome project created by @hugoabernier [https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/main/samples/react-tiles] so the credit goes to him!
